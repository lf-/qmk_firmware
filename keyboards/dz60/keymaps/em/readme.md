## Em's keymap

This is a keymap for the DZ60 with ANSI layout. It has some different glow
patterns that can be toggled through.

The main difference between this and the default keymap is that what would be
caps lock is replaced with a combined Fn and Esc key: when you hold it to
chord, it represents Fnand when tapped enters Esc.
